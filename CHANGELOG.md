Since transactions are at the core of this app, this release touches almost all subsystems and is therefore huge.

* Improved: Updated computation of account and transaction balances to be in line with accounting principles
* Improved: Updated color (red/green) display to match movement in the account, and not a representation of the side of the split
* Improved: Introduced new format for sending Transactions through Intents (while maintaining backwards compatibility)
* Improved: Extensive code refactoring for
    - Better modularity of transaction exports (and ease introduction of new formats),
    - Cleaner database schema and reduction of overlap and redundancies
    - Easier database migrations during future update (with reduced risk of data loss)
