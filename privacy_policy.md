GnuCash Android App Privacy Policy
==================================

Gnucash Android uses the third party service Crashlytics for collecting the crash log data (if enabled). 
This information is used by the app developers to fix issues in the app and improve functionality.

No personally identifiable information is automatically collected as part of this process.
The privacy policy of the Crashlytics service can be found here: http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf
	 
By default the crash log submission is turned off. If you opt-in to submit crash logs, 
we collect information which includes, but is not limited to, device state information, 
unique device identifiers, device hardware and OS information relating to how the application functions.
                                            
For users of the beta version of the app, the collection of log data is switched on by default (with the possibility to opt out). 
For all other regular users, the collection of the data is opt-in.
